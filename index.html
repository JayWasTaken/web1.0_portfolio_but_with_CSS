        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>
        Hi! My name is Janelle, but most people call me Jay. 
        I have been immersing myself in learning at my current college and enjoying the newfound energy that it has brought.
        I have two cats currently and am studying Japanese in my free time.
        My hobbies are swimming, making pottery, painting, and gaming.
